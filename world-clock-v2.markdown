World Clock v2 
---------------
My siblings, my folks and I are all living continents apart! Thus it was high time I redesigned my [world clock](https://codepen.io/tvweinstock/pen/JGXaBb) to include the day of the week and the weather* where we all live! 
The weather data was fetched with the help of an async function to cut down on promise chaining. 
Design inspired by [Figure It Out dribbble] (https://dribbble.com/shots/1128554-Figure-it-Out).

*weather data will appear permitting I haven't maxed out the requests on my [free API key](https://openweathermap.org/price) ðŸ™ˆ
